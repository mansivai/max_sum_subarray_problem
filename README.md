# max_sum_subarray_problem
Let there be an array A consisting of n real numbers (may not be distinct). Design an algorithm that will output a pair (i0, j0) where i0 ≤ j0 or ⊥ (null) so that
is maximum over all pairs of (i, j) where i ≤ j. If the output is ⊥, we assume that the sum is 0. Write
a code for the same.
